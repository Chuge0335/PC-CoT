label_filter_options_prompt: "Consider the sentence: \"{text}\" alongside the potential topic options provided: {options}. Your task is to exclude up to 50% of labels from the given topic options. Recognize that some labels may be linked in a wider sense, even without direct mention in the text. Prioritize identifying and removing labels that are irrefutably irrelevant or unsuitable, while avoiding the dismissal of those that could be relevant. Separate your decisions with a comma, for example 'aaa', 'bbb'.\nREMOVED LABELS:"
label_filter_topn_prompt: "Considering the sentence: \"{text}\", you are provided with a set of potential topics given as: {topn_label}. Your main goal is precision in identifying truly irrelevant labels while keeping possible meaningful connections. Note that the label may not has direct mention in text but may related in the broader context. Aim to identify and eliminate only those labels that are markedly unrelated or unsuitable, being cautious not to remove those that could be pertinent. Finally, present the removed options in the following format: 'REMOVED LABELS: [ the removed option list ]'. "
